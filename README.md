# CRUD_JAVA
This is a project made in JAVA using CRUD operations where you can create, read, update and delete users accounts, query users loans and store personal data.
The main goal of this app is to manage a whole library system, where users can loan books and they can register their activities, which activities will be stored into a database
hosted in phpMyAdmin server. Also users will be able to query their records they have done at the library.

This the phpMyAdmin server where the database is.
